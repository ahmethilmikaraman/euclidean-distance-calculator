A Python-based program to calculate the Euclidean distance between multiple points in a 2D plane. The script iterates through all point pairs in a given list, computes the distance between each pair, and identifies the pair with the shortest distance.

Features:
-Efficiently calculates Euclidean distance for all pairs of points.
-Determines the shortest distance and the corresponding points.
-Fully customizable for various coordinate datasets.
-Uses a straightforward implementation of loops and lambda functions for simplicity.

Perfect for those learning Python and exploring basic computational geometry!
